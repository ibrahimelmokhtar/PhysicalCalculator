# PhysicalCalculator

A real-life application where you can use it as a physical calculator for basic operations (+, -, *, /). It was implemented by using TivaC TM4C123GH6PM, LCD, and Keypad.
This application was originally developed in **2017-2018** during a college course.

## What I learnt

* Building an embedded system
* Register manipulation
* Reading datasheet and fetching wanted information
* Wiring diagram
* How LCD and Keypad works in depth (Low-level)
